            <i>"She only sits next to the Doc and just suctions saliva."</i>,
            thats what people might thinks about this job. Though there is so
            much more about this job. It's not just that you have to suction
            saliva, <strong>no!</strong> You often stand as if your spine was
            made of rubber, sometimes for long periods of time. This is very
            good for your back and you will feel like a new born baby
            afterwards. Another nice side of the job is the friendly patients.
            They always come in with a smile in their faces and you can already
            see the twinkling stars. I love my job! (Dont take this to serious!
            ;))
